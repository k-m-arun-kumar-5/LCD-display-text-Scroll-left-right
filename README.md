Description :
=============
I,  K.M. Arun Kumar alias Arunkumar Murugeswaran, just shared my works, which I worked as learning path and practiced Embedded C programming using PIC16F887 (Microchip's 8 bit microcontroller in PIC16 family) such as in LCD, running text is displayed to left and to right with specified number of gaps between
consecutive same text display.

CAUTION:
========
Schematics and simulation is done by Proteus CAD. NOT EXPERIMENTED IN REAL TIME ENVIRONMENT.

Purpose :
=========
In all my respective repositories, I just shared my works that I worked as the learning path and practiced, with designed, developed, implemented, simulated and tested, including some projects, assignments, documentations and all other related files and some programming that might not being implement, not being completed, lacks some features or have some bugs. Purpose of all my repositories, if used, can be used for LEARNING AND EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY. It can be used as the open source and freeware. Kindly read the LICENSE.txt for license, terms and conditions about the use of source codes, binaries, documentation and all other files, located in all my repositories. 

My Thanks and Tribute :
========================
I thank to my family, Friends, Teachers, People behind the toolchains and references that I used, all those who directly or indirectly supported me and/or helped me and/or my family, Nature and God. My tribute to my family, Friends, Teachers, People behind the toolchains and references that I used, Nature, Jimmy Dog, God and all those, who directly or indirectly help and/or support me and/or my family.
